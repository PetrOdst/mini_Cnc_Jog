# Mini CNC Jog

## Arduino Pro Micro based USB mini CNC jog remote controler

After some time operating my DIY CNC I realize, that ability to move axies and not loosing eye contact with tool, might by very usefull. So I came up with this.

My idea was just to by able to move axies, chace step size/length and resetting Zero, (may by on/off laser later). But since it is basiccaly programmable kayboard (with 2 rotaryEncoders includes 2 buttons which gives 6 actions if using OneButton Lib ) it offers variety of uses. Here is how I did it.

# CHAPTER I - HARDWARE

Parts list

* Arduino Pro Micro (in my case from [LaskaKit.cz](https://www.laskakit.cz/arduino-leonardo-pro-micro/))
* Rotary Encoder module (in my case from [LaskaKit.cz](https://www.laskakit.cz/rotacni-encoder-s-tlacitkem-a-rc-s-filtrem/))
* OLED Display 0.96" 128x64  (in my case from [LaskaKit.cz](https://www.laskakit.cz/oled-displej-bily-128x64-0-96--i2c/))
* PCB [fooprint/Schemas/IMG/PDG](https://github.com/PetrOdst/mini_cnc_jog/tree/main/PCB)
* 3DPrinted Housing [STL](https://github.com/PetrOdst/mini_cnc_jog/tree/main/3Dmodels)/[Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/284425-mini-cnc-jog)

### 3DPrinting instruction
Feel free to use your favorit settings, but this is what work out for me :
* Material    : Pet-G [Prusament](https://www.prusa3d.com/cs/kategorie/prusament-petg/)
* Layer hight : 0.20 mm
* Infill      : 10%
* Support     : no
* brim        : no

**!!NOTE!! - Knobs needs to be taller. Manually set models hight to 18mm in Slicer. don't forget to "unlock" rest dimensions.**

# CHAPTER II - SOFTWARE

For driving my CNC I use [UGS](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender) and it supports keymaps export/import. My keymaps.zip for version01 is available in `/code` folder. You simply install it by clicking **Preferencis.../Options  -->  Keymap  -->  Import...** in Universal Gcode Sender. 

### jog-Ver01
This very first version was made in a hurry fitt my needs. I was not meant to be modified or even understood. It is stable, but very messy and unorganized, therefore I highly recommend to use it as it is and leave it without customization.

* Arduino IDE Code [Ver01](./code/jog_ver1)
* [UGS](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender)
* [keymaps.zip](./code/keymaps.zip) 


### jog-Ver02
This version is much more organized, easyer to understand and better prepared for future mods, but it is constantly in process and there might be some bugs. If you find some, please report it.

* Arduino IDE Code [Ver02](./code/jog_ver2)
* [UGS](https://github.com/winder/Universal-G-Code-Sender)
* [keymaps.zip](./code/keymaps.zip)
