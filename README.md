# Mini CNC Jog

## Arduino Pro Micro based USB mini CNC jog remote controler

After some time operating my DIY CNC I realize, that ability to move axies and not loosing eye contact with tool, might by very usefull. So I came up with this.

My idea was just to by able to move axies, chace step size/length and resetting Zero, (may by on/off laser later). But since it is basiccaly programmable kayboard (with 2 rotaryEncoders includes 2 buttons which gives 6 actions if using OneButton Lib ) it offers variety of uses. Here is how I did it.
